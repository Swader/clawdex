# Operations

## Install or refresh

If you are starting from a blank machine, read [docs/fresh-machine-bootstrap.md](./fresh-machine-bootstrap.md) first. That document includes the OS user, passwordless sudo, Codex config, and Telegram onboarding steps needed to reproduce the current control-plane setup.

```bash
cd ~/clawdex
cp -n .env.example .env
cp -n workers.example.json workers.json
$EDITOR .env workers.json
./scripts/install.sh
./scripts/doctor.sh
```

Run both scripts as your normal user. `install.sh` prompts for `sudo` internally when it needs to create or repair `/srv/telemux` and `/srv/factory`, but all Bun and `systemctl --user` work stays under your user account.

The loader defaults to `./workers.json`. Set `FACTORY_WORKERS_FILE` in `.env` only if you want a different path.

If you want startup-time `chat_member` command registration for the control supergroup, set `FACTORY_TELEGRAM_CONTROL_CHAT_ID` in `.env` to that supergroup chat id.

Recommended worker config for phase 1:

- `control` uses `transport: "local"`
- `worker1` uses `transport: "ssh"` over the Tailscale network

## Optional Git remote setup

If you want this checkout to push to a dedicated GitHub repository without changing the identity used by other repos on the machine, create a dedicated deploy key and SSH host alias for this repo only.

- private key: `~/.ssh/clawdex_github_deploy`
- public key: `~/.ssh/clawdex_github_deploy.pub`
- SSH host alias: `github.com-clawdex`

With this setup, the repo remote can be:

```bash
git@github.com-clawdex:swader/clawdex.git
```

Paste the public key into the GitHub repo at:

- `swader/clawdex` -> `Settings` -> `Deploy keys`

Enable write access if the key should be allowed to push.

## Day 0 Telegram onboarding

1. Create or recover the bot token from `@BotFather`.
2. Put the token in `~/clawdex/.env` as `FACTORY_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=...`.
3. Add the bot to the target supergroup.
4. Ensure forum topics are enabled in the supergroup.
5. Disable bot privacy in `@BotFather` so plain text and media captions inside a bound topic reach the bot.
6. From the allowed Telegram account, send `/whoami` in the target topic.

## Common topic setups

### Control host context

In the `control-general` topic:

```text
/newctx control-general control host
```

That creates a managed local git workspace under:

- `/srv/factory/hostctx/control-general/`
- an initial git commit so future diffs start clean

### Scratchpad

In a throwaway topic:

```text
/newctx scratchpad control scratch
```

That creates:

- `/srv/factory/scratch/scratchpad/`
- an initial git commit so future diffs start clean

### Existing repo path

```text
/newctx bitfalls-dashboard control /absolute/path/to/repo
```

### Managed clone from a git URL

```text
/newctx bitfalls-dashboard worker1 https://github.com/example/project.git master
```

If the remote worker is unavailable, the context is still created and stored as `pending`.

## Using the bot

### Inspect identity and binding

```text
/help
/explainctx
/synccommands
/showcommands
/whoami
/topicinfo
/crons
/cron show <id>
/mode
/model
/effort
```

### Inspect workers

```text
/workers
```

### Start or continue work

```text
/run audit the repo and update the docs
/resume continue from the current TODO
/loop keep going until you hit a real blocker or a clean checkpoint
```

Inside a bound topic, plain text starts or resumes the stored Codex session automatically.

You can change the Codex runtime for the current topic without rebinding it:

```text
/mode fast
/mode normal
/mode max
/mode clear
/model gpt-5.4-mini
/model clear
/effort low
/effort clear
```

Preset meanings:

- `fast` -> `gpt-5.4-mini` with `low`
- `normal` -> `gpt-5.4` with `medium`
- `max` -> `gpt-5.4` with `xhigh`

These overrides are stored with the bound context and applied to both `codex exec` and `codex exec resume`, so the session continues instead of starting over.

Scheduled jobs are available too:

```text
/crons
/cron show <id>
/cron pause <id>
/cron resume <id>
/cron delete <id>
/cron move <id> here
/cron context <id> <slug-or-path>
/cron mode <id> fast
/cron model <id> gpt-5.4-mini
/cron effort <id> low
```

Natural-language scheduling works inside a bound topic as well. The normal Codex turn can now emit a control-plane cron manifest after messages like “remind me to implement Stripe every Monday at 09:00” or “change mode to fast for the email cron”.

When a context has scheduled jobs linked to it or to its bound topic, the control plane mirrors them into `.factory/CRONS.md` inside the workspace.

Captioned image or file messages use the same path. Supported inbound Telegram media is staged into the bound workspace before Codex runs. Images are also attached to the Codex prompt with `--image`, while non-image files are left on disk for Codex to inspect.

Audio and voice-only Telegram messages are intentionally blocked before Codex in the current phase. They need transcription first.

### Context lifecycle notes

- A context is the durable workspace and Codex-session binding for one Telegram topic.
- `/newctx` is usually the one-time setup step for a reusable topic.
- If `/newctx` is run in an already bound topic, the bot warns before rebinding.
- Rebinding changes future routing only.
- The old workspace stays on disk unless you archive it or delete it separately.
- Old Telegram messages stay in Telegram and are not automatically imported into the new context.

### Rebind the current topic

```text
/bind control scratch
/bind worker1 https://github.com/example/project.git master
```

Legacy `/bind <slug>` is still accepted to attach the topic to an existing stored context.

### Archive or detach

```text
/archive
/detach
```

`/archive` marks the context inactive and detaches the topic. `/detach` only removes the topic binding.

### Inspect results

```text
/tail
/artifacts
/artifacts send
/artifacts send screenshot
/usage
```

If a Codex reply says a file was created and recorded in `.factory/ARTIFACTS.md`, you can either ask for it in plain language in the same topic or explicitly run `/artifacts send [filter]` to have the control plane upload the matching file back into Telegram.

While a job is running, the bot should show a `typing...` indicator in the same topic. That is expected while `/topicinfo` reports `Busy: yes`.

For scheduled Codex jobs, if the target context is already busy, the scheduler keeps one pending run and dispatches it when the context becomes idle instead of starting a second concurrent session on the same workspace.

## Dashboard

- Main page: `http://127.0.0.1:8787/`
- Health: `http://127.0.0.1:8787/healthz`

The dashboard stays localhost-only by default.

## Telegram command scopes

- Telegram bot commands are scoped by chat/user, not by topic.
- Group topics do not have their own separate command scopes.
- The daemon registers commands for:
  `default`, `all_private_chats`, `all_group_chats`, and optionally `chat_member(chat_id=<control-group>, user_id=<allowed-telegram-user-id>)`.
- Telegram clients may still choose not to visually show slash suggestions in some group contexts even when commands are registered correctly.
- Use `/synccommands` to re-register commands and `/showcommands` to inspect what Telegram currently returns for each scope.
- This is separate from any private-chat menu button behavior; group-topic slash suggestions are not fixed with `setChatMenuButton`.

## Service management

```bash
systemctl --user status telemux.service
systemctl --user restart telemux.service
journalctl --user -u telemux.service -f
```

After changing the control plane source under `~/clawdex/src`, restart `telemux.service` because the unit runs directly from `bun run src/main.ts`.

The internal scheduler lives in the same service. There is no separate OS cron or timer to restart.

## Boot readiness

- The user systemd service must be enabled: `systemctl --user enable --now telemux.service`
- `loginctl enable-linger <user>` is required if the service should start after reboot without login
- Recommended reboot test:
  reboot the machine, do not log in locally first, then verify from Telegram only with `/whoami`, `/workers`, and plain text in an already bound topic

## Worker troubleshooting

### Worker unavailable

- Run `/workers`
- Confirm the worker shows `status=unreachable` instead of crashing the daemon
- Confirm the SSH target and user in `workers.json`
- Confirm Tailscale networking between the control host and the remote worker
- Confirm `sshd`, `git`, `bash`, and `codex` exist on the worker

If the worker is unavailable, context creation should land in `pending`.

### Context bootstrap failed locally

- Inspect `/topicinfo`
- Inspect `/tail`
- Fix the local repo/workspace issue
- Retry `/run`, `/resume`, or `/newctx`
- If a task deleted its own bound worktree, the run should now fail cleanly instead of leaving the topic permanently busy. Older stuck runs still need a one-time `systemctl --user restart telemux.service` or manual process cleanup.

### Telegram receives nothing

- Confirm the service is running
- Confirm the token in `.env`
- Confirm the bot is in the target supergroup
- Confirm privacy mode is disabled
- Check `journalctl --user -u telemux.service -n 200 --no-pager`

### Telegram media message was ignored or incomplete

- Confirm the message had either text or a caption, or at least one supported non-audio attachment
- Remember that Telegram photo captions arrive as `caption`, not `text`
- Inspect `.factory/inbox/telegram/` in the bound workspace for staged input files
- Check `journalctl --user -u telemux.service -n 200 --no-pager` for download or staging errors
- Audio/voice-only messages are expected to stop before Codex in the current phase

### Busy topic shows no typing indicator

- Confirm `/topicinfo` reports `Busy: yes`
- Confirm the topic is a real forum topic with a `message_thread_id`
- Check `journalctl --user -u telemux.service -n 200 --no-pager` for `telegram typing heartbeat failed`
- If replies still arrive normally, treat the missing indicator as a Telegram client/UI issue first

### Scheduled job did not fire

- Run `/crons` in the target topic and confirm the job is enabled with a valid `next=` value
- Check the dashboard or `/cron show <id>` for `pending`, `last error`, and target/context mismatch
- Check `journalctl --user -u telemux.service -n 200 --no-pager` for cron scheduler errors
- Remember there is no downtime catch-up; jobs missed while the service was down are fast-forwarded to the next future occurrence
