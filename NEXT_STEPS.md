# Final Manual Steps

## For a fresh control host

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if you have not already.
2. Copy `workers.example.json` to `workers.json`.
3. Set `FACTORY_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<real-token>`.
4. Add the bot to the target Telegram supergroup and make sure forum topics are enabled.
5. Disable bot privacy in `@BotFather` so plain text inside a bound topic is visible.
6. Run:

```bash
./scripts/install.sh
./scripts/doctor.sh
```

Run those as your control user, not with `sudo`. `install.sh` now prompts for `sudo` internally only for the privileged `/srv` and linger setup, and keeps Bun-related work under that user account.

Only set `FACTORY_WORKERS_FILE` in `.env` if you want the worker config somewhere other than `./workers.json`.

7. In Telegram, send `/whoami` in the exact topic you want to use.
8. Create the first local host context:

```text
/newctx control-general control host
```

9. Optional: create a scratch topic:

```text
/newctx scratchpad control scratch
```

At that point, the control host is usable even if the remote worker is still offline.

Once a topic is active, artifact files can be returned into the same Telegram topic either by asking for them in plain language or by using `/artifacts send [filter]`.

Supported inbound Telegram media now stages into the bound workspace automatically. Voice and audio transcription is still a later phase.

Topic-local Codex runtime switching is also available now through `/mode`, `/model`, and `/effort`.

Scheduled jobs are now available through `/crons`, `/cron ...`, and natural-language cron requests emitted by Codex via `.factory/CRON_REQUESTS.json`.

## Manual remote-worker work for later

These are the remaining manual prerequisites before remote repo execution on the remote worker will work cleanly:

1. Enable `sshd` on the remote worker.
2. Decide on the remote SSH user and update `workers.json`.
3. Trust the control host SSH key on the remote worker.
4. Confirm Tailscale networking between the control host and the remote worker.
5. Confirm `git`, `bash`, and `codex` are installed on the remote worker.
6. Create a pending remote host topic when you are ready:

```text
/newctx worker-general worker1 host
```

7. For a repo topic, either bind an existing path or give a git URL:

```text
/newctx myproj worker1 https://github.com/example/project.git master
```

If the remote worker is still unavailable, those contexts should remain `pending` instead of failing hard.
